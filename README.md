# tic-tac-toe

Digital implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game
(also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os).

Game features 3 modes:
- player vs. player
- player vs. easy bot
- player vs. impossible bot

Easy bot chooses a random square from the pool of possible moves
and places it's mark there.

Impossible bot uses an AI made with a minimax algorithm selecting
the optimal spot to place it's mark based on all possible scenarios
calculated in the moment a player makes their move.

Minimax algorithm created with the help of:
